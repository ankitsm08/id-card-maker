# ID Card Maker

This project is a Python-based application for creating ID cards. It allows users to input their details and generates a professional-looking ID card in image format. These batches of images can be further be bundled into a PDF file for printing.

This was created as a part of Maa Tara Seva Samiti's initiative to provide ID cards to its members, which I was a part of. This helped in automating the process of creating ID cards for the members.
